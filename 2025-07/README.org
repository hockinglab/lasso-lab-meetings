Group meeting schedule, Summer 2025

Time 9-10 on Monday mornings in D4-2011.

What to present?
1. your research.
2. somebody else's paper.
3. some useful software.

Suggested schedule below. Feel free to change!

- July 21: Toby: SOAK: Same/Other/All K-fold cross-validation for estimating similarity of patterns in data subsets. [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08643][arXiv paper]], [[https://github.com/tdhock/two-new-algos-sci-ml?tab=readme-ov-file#title-abstract-slides][slides]]
- July 28: Felix: Présentation sur le projet [[https://github.com/Chabam/neolvox/tree/standalone][LVox]] (sujet de maîtrise)
- July 30 @ 13h: Workshop: R package development using GitHub and Pull Requests. Reading:
  - [[https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2025/computational-research-organization/][my guide to organizing computational research projects]], section Writing Pull Requests.
  - [[https://r-pkgs.org/][R packages]], and [[https://happygitwithr.com/][Happy Git and GitHub for the useR]] online book.
  - [[https://git-scm.com/book/fr/v2/GitHub-Contribution-%C3%A0-un-projet][git-scm docs en français]], [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project][English]].
  - Abstract: Git is a version control system for managing source code, and GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories. When you want other people to review your code, it is best to create a Pull Request, which summarizes a set of modifications to review, and allows others to add comments to suggest improvements. In this workshop I will explain how to use Pull Requests on GitHub, using the example of developing an R package, and asking for code review.
- Aug 4: Justine : Precision-Recall Curves
  - [[https://www.canva.com/design/DAGuvjWO7dU/sfM6xGgP4fpXiFJ6gxmb9g/viewutm_content=DAGuvjWO7dU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h8d76aa5b2f][Slides]] (not updated)
  - [[https://github.com/juruch/Internship-Sherbrooke/tree/main/PR-AUM][Repo]] with updated codes and figures (see [[https://github.com/juruch/Internship-Sherbrooke/blob/main/PR-AUM/FirstResults.md][FirstResults.R]])
  - Abstract : This presentation sums up my work up until August 4th. How I went from ROC to Precision-Recall which modifications and computation changes I did. It also features a few (outdated) figures I did using [[https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2025/mlr3torch-conv][this code]] modified to use my own Precision-Recall functions.
- Aug 11: no meeting (Toby absent).
- Aug 15, 9am: Omar : Optimisation des courbes ROC multi-classes.

 Abstract: This presentation explores the optimization of ROC curves for multi-class classification tasks, with a focus on imbalanced datasets. Starting from the limitations of traditional ROC–AUC in imbalanced class distributions. The work extends binary Area under the minimum (AUM) concepts to multi-class settings using  one-vs-all strategies, and evaluates both macro and micro averaging approaches. The final section applies these ideas to language models pre-training.

- Aug 25: Toby
- Sep 1: Felix

- TODO animint2 R package: animated, interactive data visualization. I will give some demos of the animint2 software, and explain some new functionality and documentation that we are working on this summer (French translation, improved tooltips, non-overlapping labels, etc).
