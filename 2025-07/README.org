  - Abstract: Git is a version control system for managing source code, and GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories. When you want other people to review your code, it is best to create a Pull Request, which summarizes a set of modifications to review, and allows others to add comments to suggest improvements. In this workshop I will explain how to use Pull Requests on GitHub, using the example of developing an R package, and asking for code review.
